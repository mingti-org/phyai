"""Whole-robot interface, composite session composition, and snapshot helpers.

This module provides:
1. `Robot`: Structural Protocol defining the abstract contract for robot hardware.
   All implementations provide schema inspection, connection lifecycle, observation
   acquisition, command submission, and safe stopping.
2. `CompositeRobot`: Implementation that composes multiple heterogeneous transport
   backends (e.g. ROS 2 joint publishers, ROS 2 video decoders, CAN grippers) into a
   single unified robot interface. Field routing is determined strictly by declared
   key ownership.
3. `take_snapshot` & `wait_for_observation`: Bounded polling utilities for acquiring
   complete, schema-validated, fresh sensor snapshots without blocking the control loop.

    3. Non-Transactional Submission: Full command validation occurs before the first
       backend write begins. However, writes across separate physical buses (e.g. ROS + CAN)
       are not atomic. If an intermediate backend write fails, all opened backends are
       stopped to transition the robot to a safe state.

       are accumulated using BaseExceptionGroup rather than silently dropping subsequent errors.
