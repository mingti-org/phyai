"""The standard robot-side deployment lifecycle against a resident model server.

Lifecycle Protocol & Invariants:
    Every robot client follows an identical deterministic 11-step execution sequence:
    1. Query Model Spec: `spec = policy.info()` retrieves server schemas and metadata
       (e.g. required camera image size, input state dimensionality).
    2. Zero-I/O Embodiment Construction: `embodiment = build(spec)` constructs the
       CompositeRobot and VectorAdapter without opening any ROS nodes or physical sockets.
    3. Handshake Schema Verification: Verifies that `adapter.request_schema` matches the
       server's declared `spec.inputs` contract before reserving the server or connecting.
    4. Register Reverse Cleanup: Registers `policy.close` and `robot.close` in an ExitStack.
       Guarantee: Hardware is stopped and closed BEFORE the model run reservation is freed.
    5. Reserve Run: `policy.begin_run()` reserves exclusive server access and resets RNG noise.
    6. Connect Hardware: `robot.connect()` establishes native ROS 2 or transport sessions.
    7. Initial Snapshot: `wait_for_observation()` polls until all sensors report fresh samples.
    8. Warmup Execution: `policy.warmup(request)` executes the first forward pass, and the
       returned action chunk is validated in full and discarded. (Surfaces compilation or
       dimension errors before physical motion is enabled).
    9. Re-verify Freshness: Because warmup may take several seconds, sensor freshness is
       re-audited before actuation.
    10. Actuator Enablement: `embodiment.activate()` enables controller user command routing
        (e.g., Tianji calling `set_ready` -> `set_mode` -> `set_input(3)`).
    11. Control Loop Execution: `deployment.run(max_steps=max_steps)` starts the real-time loop.
