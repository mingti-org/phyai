"""Robot deployment coordinator: background inference worker and real-time control loop.

Architecture:
    RobotDeployment coordinates two concurrent execution contexts:
    1. Background Producer Thread (_produce):
       - Monitors scheduler state (via `scheduler.wants_inference()`).
       - Acquires fresh observation snapshots (under `_io_lock`).
       - Translates snapshots via `adapter.to_request(obs, context)`.
       - Calls synchronous model prediction via `policy.predict(request)`.
         (Crucial: Prediction runs WITHOUT holding `_io_lock`, ensuring stalled GPU
         inference never blocks hardware emergency shutdown).
       - Validates predictions and submits them to `scheduler.add_chunk()`.
    2. Real-Time Actuator Control Thread (_execute):
       - Driven by a monotonic host clock at `options.control_hz` (e.g. 200 Hz).
       - Queries `scheduler.action_at(tick_ns)` to retrieve interpolated targets.
       - Enforces strict lateness bounds (`max_control_lateness_s`): skips dropped ticks
         rather than emitting dangerous high-frequency catch-up command bursts.
       - Dispatches commands to hardware via `robot.send_action(action)` (under `_io_lock`).

Synchronization & Shutdown:
    - An internal `threading.Condition` coordinates producer-consumer signaling.
    - `_io_lock` serializes all hardware operations on `Robot` (get_observation, send_action, stop, close).
    - Shutdown Sequence: When stopping, `robot.stop()` and `robot.close()` execute immediately
      under `_io_lock`, preempting actuator motion even if a background model forward pass
      is still running or blocked.
